This is a not a comprehensive list of rules, there are no loopholes. 

This is not a comprehensive set of rules, you are responsible for your actions and should use common sense, if you think you shouldn't be doing something then don't do it. As of right now, I'm hoping these shouldn't have to be heavily enforced.

These rules are subject to change, and punishments are subject to the judgment of admins. If you have a suggestion or think that a rule needs to be changed please [please submit a feedback form](https://forms.gle/D5ebS5zFmLNCyuSTA).

## Server rules

These rules are related to playing on the Minecraft server, Discord rules are listed there.

1.  ### Greifing is prohibited

    Causing excessive damage to builds, taking items without permission, and intentionally causing excessive harm to other players is not allowed. This does not prohibit pranks and good matured trolling.

2.  ### Be considerate of server performance

    Using excessive tile entities, leaving large machines running for long periods of time, and doing other things that cause server lag should be avoided.

3.  ### Be respectful to other players

    Be respectful when interacting with other players, banter is fine, but if it devolves into general toxicity then it needs to stop.

4.  ### Don't use illegal modifications

    Hacked clients, x-ray mods and resource packs, and exploits are prohibited, a list of allowed mods can be found [here](https://github.com/CarbonGhost/Prosperity/wiki/Allowed-mods).

5.  ### Don't ask for special treatment

    Don't ask admins to give you items, teleport you, etc. In most cases these commands are disabled for OP players anyways.

## Wiki rules

These rules pertain to the wiki on GitHub, you know, the one you're reading right now.

1.  ### Don't edit if you don't know what you're doing

    If you're unfamiliar with markdown, or GitHub in general, please don't attempt to edit the Wiki. If there is a change you wish to be made then ask somebody who knows what they're doing, or ask me.

2.  ### Don't add low quality submissions

    Submissions with excessive typos, wrong or poorly explained information, or redundant submissions are not allowed.

## Soft rules

These rules exist but aren't likely to be frequently enforced or aren't particularly strict.

1.  ### Keep standards high

    Meme builds, NSFW map art, and low effort projects don't belong on this server. You're not going to be banned for having an ugly house, but please try your best to finish projects and keep a high standard of building.

2.  ### Stay on the Discord

    If you leave the Discord server moderation gets significantly more difficult on my end, you are likely to be removed from the whitelist if you leave, but are welcome to play again when you re-join the Discord server.
