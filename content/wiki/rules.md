This is not a comprehensive list of rules, and the specifics of enforcement are left up to the judgment of staff. There are no loopholes. That being said, this server is not very strict and we are happy to clarify things if needed.

Please be aware they you are free to use any technical mechanics that you wish, such as light suppression, large scale farms, chunk loaders, etc. as long as they do not conflict with any other rules. This does not cover duping in any form.

# Chat rules

These rules apply to the in-game chat, voice-chat, and Discord server.

#### 1. Don't spam

Don't spam emojis or use excessive GIFs, and try to avoid sending several single word messages instead of a complete sentence.

#### 2. Don't post or link to NSFW content

Don't post or link to content that is not safe for work, this includes offensive content, gore, or in appropriate content.

#### 3. Don't discuss sensitive topics

Please do not discuss serious topics here, primarily politics. As important and relevant as these issues may be, this is not the place to talk about them.

#### 4. Act mature

Try your best to be mature and polite when having conversations. Avoid spamming or misusing Discord channels.

# Minecraft rules

#### 1. Be respectful to other players

Please be considerate of others on the server, do not modify other's builds without permission or cause drama.

#### 2. Be considerate of server performance

Please do your best to build lag efficient farms and be aware of any lag that you may cause on the server. You are allowed to use chunk loaders, but please avoid constantly loading an excess number of chunks and entities.

#### 3. Don't abuse server features

Do not abuse server features, like `/cam` or Carpet fake players. This includes using camera mode to find resources and spawning excess numbers of bots.

#### 4. Don't use illegal modifications

Do not use any illegal mods, you can find a list of explicitly banned mods on the [allowed mods](allowed-mods) page. If you feel unsure about a mod, feel free to ask about it.

#### 5. Don't ask for special treatment

Don't ask for special treatment from staff members, this includes asking for a new player to be whitelisted regardless of their application or running admin commands like `/tp` or `/give`.

#### 6. Report any exploits

Please report any issues that are found with the server configuration or system, such as allowing you to run admin commands, access server data, or duplicate or modify items in a way that is unintentional. If you find and report an exploit without abusing it you will not be punished.

#### 7. Keep standards high

Do your best to repair any broken community builds, and avoid creating low effort or ugly builds.
