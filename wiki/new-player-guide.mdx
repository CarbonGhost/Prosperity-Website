## So What Now?

Assuming you've just now been whitelisted, you may not have the full picture of what Prosperity is about.

In short, this server is about making really cool things together, whether you are a builder, technical player, or anything else, that's what we all want to achieve. In part to accomplish this goal, this server takes advantage of a carefully curated set of new features and mechanics allowing more things to be farmed, new ways of thinking with Redstone, and a better quality-of-life than vanilla Minecraft.

## Mods & Tools

You may join the server with a vanilla, Fabric, or Forge client, however our recommendation is that you use our [client modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/prosperity) which is pre-configured with all the most common mods people use for this server.

Even if you wish to make your own personal modpack, or largely avoid mods, it may be useful to gain some familiarity with the most common mods used by members of the community.

### Carpet

[Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) is the basis for the vast majority of the [new mechanics and features](/wiki/features) that have been added to the server. The mod is very stable and is completely intercompatible with vanilla, allowing the world to be run without mods, and features to be enabled and disabled at any time.

In addition to the base Carpet mod a huge number of extensions have been created, many of which we use, more on the [mods page](/wiki/mods).

### Litematica & Syncmatica

[Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) is Fabric mod which provides the ability to create and manipulate in-world schematics and precisely track their material requirements. This has a wide range of applications and is used by both technical players and builders.

[Syncmatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/syncmatica) is an separate extension which allows schematics to be uploaded and synced for multiple members on the server. This is most useful for large scale community projects.

### Simple Voice Chat & Audioplayer

[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) allows proximity voice chat via Minecraft for all of those who have the mod. Admittedly this feature does see limited use, however it may be nice to have for group projects.

[Audioplayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/audioplayer) is an extension to Simple Voice Chat allowing players to create and play back custom music discs.
