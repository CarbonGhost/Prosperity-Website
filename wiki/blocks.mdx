# Functional Blocks

## Globe

A rare item found in shipwrecks or sold by the wandering trader. The globe will display a randomly generated world that is unique to the world seed and can be interacted with or powered by Redstone to spin and display the current coordinates.

Can be used with a comparator.

## Candle Holders

Candle holders can be placed on walls, floors, and ceilings and stacked like candles with up to 4 per block and give off a bit more light that candles.

## Awning

A decorative awning that can be tilted when interacted with. Crouching while on an awning will make the player fall through it. Falling onto an awning will make the player bounce off of it.

## Pedestal

A decorative block for displaying your finest treasures, the pedestal can display one item or block, with special visual effects for weapons, tools, and globes. When stacked vertically the pedestal will visually connect.

Once an item is taken from a pedestal the block will update, detectable by observer. This can be prevented if one swaps the item with a sack.

If an End crystal is placed on a pedestal the block will give off an enchanting power equal to 3 bookshelves. This means that an enchanting power surrounded by 5 of such blocks can be fully powered.

## Present

The present is a container block with one slot. When interacting with the present’s GUI one may choose a player to whom it will be addressed, as well as a small description.

Once packed only you and the recipient will be able to open it and access its content.

## Notice Board

The notice board can hold and display either a written book, a map, or a banner pattern. The text size will automatically scale to the amount of content on a page; adding more whitespace will make the same amount of text appear smaller.

Upon receiving a redstone signal the notice board will turn to the next page of a displayed book.

The block can be waxed to prevent player interactions.

## Fodder

-   A layered block that serves as a way to automatically feed animals
-   Many animals (controlled via a tag) will try to eat a layer out of the block when they are hungry
-   When eaten it will make baby animals age faster and will set adults in love. Uses the vanilla cooldown
-   Can be placed down with dispensers
-   Clicking with a hoe will remove and destroy one layer

## Bamboo Spikes

-   Spikes that will slow and damage all the mobs that walk in them
-   If quark or create are installed they can be pushed with pistons or contraptions and will deal extra damage if they hit something while extending
-   Can be infused with lingering potions. To do so either craft them, click on them or pour the potion using a faucet
-   By default they can only accept negative lingering potions and have infinite charge.
-   You can however enable an alternative mode in the configs which allows them to have 16 changes and accept any potion. Charges will only be depleted when an entity that does not have that potion effect walks over them

## Blackboard

-   Can be written on to create interesting pattern in black and white. Basically a bare bones MS Paint in Minecraft
-   Can also be directly edited without the GUI by holding a dye item. This also supports other mods like chalk or similar items like quatz or coal. Doing so won't consume the item
-   Will keep its drawing when broken.
-   The current drawing can be previewed using the item tool tip
-   Blackboards can be duplicated just like banners
-   Can be cleared by using a wet sponge or soap
-   Can be waxed to prevent interactions
-   Can accept glow ink
-   Colored blackboards can be enabled in the configs

## Framed Blocks

-   Framed blocks come in 3 shapes: Braces, Cross Braces and Frames
-   Each of them can visually hold any solid block inside. This allows to make every block into a framed one. To do so simply click on it with said block
-   An option to frame an already placed block when clicking on it with this item is available in the configs
-   Using an axe on a framed block will break the frame but not the block contained inside

## Safe

-   Acts as a sort of upgraded shulker box that is fire resistant
-   Safes can be locked with a key. Once this is done their content will only be available to players that have the correct key in their inventory. See the key section for more info
-   An optional config is avialable in the configs that allows them to get bounded to the first player the places them, without the need to use a key
-   To unlock and clear the ownership of a safe simply shift click on it with its key or a tripwire hook if simple safes are enabled
-   In the configs one can also enable an option to make them indestructible unless one holds the correct key
-   Creative players can bypass locks

## Netherite Doors & Trapdoors

Netherite doors and trapdoors are able be locked with a key, disabling interactions by players other than the key owner. By default they are fully accessible by any player.

## Gold Doors & Trapdoors

When powered by Redstone, players will be unable to interact with it.

## Ropes

Ropes can be placed against a ceiling, on a fence or wall, or next to an already placed rope. Just like scaffolding, ropes can only go that far out horizontally from their closest support until they are no longer supported. Ropes can be placed and will wrap themselves around fences and walls.

Vertical ropes have no hitbox and can be climbed or slow the player down when falling; horizontal ropes do have a hitbox and can be walked on, albeit at a slower paste. Can be broken by a projectile. Sheared to remove its bottom part.

Placing a rope against an existing vertical one will result in the rope getting extended downwards, pushing all blocks that are attached to the bottom most rope. The opposite is also true and can be achieved by shift clicking a rope with an empty hand. This will pull up the last attached block.

## Jar

Jars can store up to 12 cookies and stored cookies can be eaten by interacting with the placed Jar. The Jar may also be filled with 12 bowls of soup or 12 potions that may be consumed.

## Goblet

Goblets can hold and display any liquid. Liquid from a Goblet can be consumed instantly when interacted with by a player and the state of the block can be accessed with a Comparator.

(source: [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries))

## Sack

The Sack functions like a Shulker box with 9 slots. The Sack is affected by gravity and deals damage when falling on an entity. The fill level can be accessed with a Comparator.

The Sack can fall vertically, but cannot be moved with a piston.
