In-order to join the server you must first download the official modpack. It is recommended that you either use Prism Launcher or the official Modrinth App in order to download and manage your mods.

Once you have downloaded your desired launcher you may find the modpack available at modrinth.com/modpack/prosperity or by searching for it in your launcher.

Ensure you download the latest >2.x version of the modpack from Modrinth. Updates will be released semi-regularly and will be accompanied with an announcement.
