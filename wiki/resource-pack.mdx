};

Prosperity makes use of a server resource pack, which is used to allow for the customization of items.

This resource pack exclusively makes use of the vanilla `CustomModelData` item property, which means that custom items work with an entirely unmodified client. The pack also includes only custom items, so you need not worry about incompatibility with any other resource packs you may be using.

## Customizing Your Items

Custom textures can be applied, changed, and removed with the [`customize`](https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Scripts/blob/main/utilities/customize.sc) command.

| Command                        | Description                                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/customize model set <model>` | Sets the current item to a model defined by the custom resource pack |
| `/customize model clear`       | Clears the current item's custom model                               |
| `/customize lore set <text>`   | Adds lore text to your item                                          |
| `/customize lore clear`        | Removed the lore text from your item                                 |
| `/customize name set <text>`   | Changes the name of your item                                        |
| `/customize name clear`        | Removes the custom name from your item                               |
| `/customize reload`            | Reloads the model aliases file                                       |
| `/customize help`              | Prints this very message                                             |

To change your item's texture you may do so by holding the item in your hand, then entering `/customize model set`. Every custom model that is available for your item will be shown in the command suggestion menu for you to choose from.
