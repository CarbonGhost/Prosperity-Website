# Ships

Ships are a flexible new form of transportation that you can use in oceans, rivers, and seas; come in every wood type and can be customized to your play style. Ships can be used to transport multiple players, mobs, and have an inventory.

The well informed shipwright should know:

-   Interacting with the ship using an iron nugget, and with a supply of planks in your inventory, will repair the ship
-   The ship can be named with a name tag
-   Sails can be customized by coloring with dyes
-   A lead can be used to leash the ship to a fence post, preventing players from moving the ship

## Ship Performance

To cater to your desired use, four ship types are available. The Galley, designed for warm biomes, and the Cog, Drakkar, and Brigg, designed for use in cold biomes. In terms of performance, cold-water ships will be 10% faster in cold water biomes but 10% slower in warm water biomes, the converse being true for warm water ships.

A ship may be further outfitted to it’s purpose by affixing cannons or shields; the former being fed from cannonballs stocked in the ship’s inventory. A penalty of -2.5% speed is applied for each cannon.
