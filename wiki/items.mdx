## Slingshot

The Slingshot can be used to shoot blocks. Shot blocks will place themselves wherever they land if the position is suitable. The Slingshot may be enchanted with Quick Charge, Multishot, and Stasis.

Stasis is a new enchantment for the Slingshot which removes the projectile drop. The maximum distance for the Slingshot with the Stasis enchantment is about 45 blocks.

## Wrench

Wrenches are tools which can be used to rotate any kind of rotatable block. The Wrench also works on blocks you might not expect it to, like signs, way signs, double skulls, double chests, and beds.

Additionally, Wrenches double as fast melee weapons which deal the same damage as a Wooden Sword but is much faster and can even be enchanted with knockback.
