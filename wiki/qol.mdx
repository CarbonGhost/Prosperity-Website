# Commands

## Stuff

[Bot Players](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Current-Available-Settings#commandplayer) is a feature which allows you to spawn a "bot" which can be manipulated with commands. This is typically used for AFKing at farms or precisely placing blocks in farms at specific tick intervals, as bots have no risk of being disconnected from the server, nor any connection latency.

[Ping Command](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra#commandping) allows yuo to check your connection latency with the `/ping` command.

[Accurate Block Placement](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra#accurateblockplacement)

[Disabled Dragon Block Damage](https://github.com/manyrandomthings/minitweaks#dragonblockdamage)

[Disabled Creeper Block Damage](https://github.com/manyrandomthings/minitweaks#nocreeperblockbreaking)

[TimeOutOut](https://modrinth.com/mod/timeoutout) is a mod which removes the vanilla connection timeout and prevents those players with a poor internet connection from being kicked by the game.
